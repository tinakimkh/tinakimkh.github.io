        <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
        <p>I wrote the HTML by hand in VIm. </p>
        <p>I am building for several reasons. I'd like to familiarize myself with using Git, Git-Pages, and Git-Hub for software development. 
        I'd like to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS; in particular, I'd like to get a sense for what it takes to create modern web-pages from scratch. Lastly, I'd like to build a dope enough personal website for my sister to encourage her to produce more art and share it with whoever might be interested.</p>
        <p>To add to the intentions behind building this website, we'd like to familiarize ourselves with the vocabulary tossed around in industrial settings that refer to producing technical items (websites, web apps, other realms of software, etc.). One, to personal edification, but also so as to be able to communicate more fluently/fluidly with people in that realm. We also want to get our hands dirty with some basic JavaScript. This project can apprently be headed under "front end development" </p>
