        <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
        <p>This is an HTML page I created in VIM</p>
        <p>I am building for several reasons. I'd like to familiarize myself with using Git, Git-Pages, and Git-Hub for software development. 
        I'd like to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS; in particular, I'd like to get a sense for what it takes to create modern web-pages from scratch. 
        Lastly, I'd like to build a dope enough personal website for my sister to encourage her to produce more art and share it with whoever might be interested.</p>
